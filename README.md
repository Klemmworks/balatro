# Balatro Win Recorder 
Welcome to the Balatro Win Recorder! As of the time of making this, Balatro has sadly not introduced run/seed history. It has been said to be in development, so this is a simple CLI-based bandage over the problem until it can be fixed at the root level. To start recording, Fork or Clone the repository, or simply download the script to your computer.

## Limitations
This script only prompts you to record the data available to you at the end of a winning run. You will need to enter 'Endless Mode' to retrieve the necessary information after obtaining the seed.

## Use
Running the script will create the following file and folder in the script's location.
- balatro.md
  - Used to store a quick reference winning seeds table
- winning-details/
  - Used to store individual run details as `.md` files
